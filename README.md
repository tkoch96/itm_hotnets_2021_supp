# Hotnets 2021 Internet Traffic Map -- Figure 2b
Subscriber counts for large eyeball networks come from various online sources and reports. We found it easier to show you where we obtained the data and how we generated the figure rather than include many citations in our paper. The links worked as of October 2021, but we cannot guarantee they will work in years to come.

## Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt
python hotnets_2b.py

Running the file will generate the figure in the paper.

## Subscriber Counts
These are in the object subscriber_counts (defined line 84). Links to reference where these counts were obtained are commented inline.

## Questions/Comments
